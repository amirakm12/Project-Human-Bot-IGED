# Entry Points and Launch Scripts - FIXED ✅

## Issue Resolution

**Problem**: Missing or broken entry points or launch scripts. The project lacked a clear, conventional entry point (`main.py`) that users typically expect.

**Solution**: Created multiple entry points and launch scripts to provide clear, accessible ways to start the IGED application.

## New Entry Points Created

### 1. `main.py` - Primary Entry Point ⭐
- **Purpose**: Conventional main entry point expected by Python developers
- **Usage**: `python main.py`
- **Features**: 
  - Clear startup messaging
  - Error handling and helpful error messages
  - Delegates to the existing `launcher.py` for actual execution
  - Cross-platform compatibility

### 2. `run.py` - Quick Launch Script
- **Purpose**: Alternative simple entry point
- **Usage**: `python run.py`
- **Features**:
  - Quick launcher with minimal output
  - Subprocess-based execution for isolation
  - Clean error handling

### 3. `run.bat` - Windows Batch Script
- **Purpose**: Windows double-click launcher
- **Usage**: Double-click `run.bat` or run from command prompt
- **Features**:
  - Python installation verification
  - File existence checks
  - Error handling with pause for debugging
  - Clear console output

### 4. `run.sh` - Linux/Mac Shell Script
- **Purpose**: Unix-based systems launcher
- **Usage**: `./run.sh` or `bash run.sh`
- **Features**:
  - Python 3 installation verification
  - Auto-executable permissions
  - Cross-platform shell compatibility
  - Clean error reporting

## Existing Entry Points (Already Available)

### `launcher.py` - Detailed Control Entry Point
- **Purpose**: Advanced entry point with full control and logging
- **Usage**: `python launcher.py`
- **Features**: Complete system initialization, dependency checking, GUI/web interface selection

## How to Launch IGED

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# Any of these will work:
python main.py           # Primary entry point
python run.py           # Quick launcher
./run.sh               # Linux/Mac script
run.bat                # Windows script (double-click)
```

### Advanced Start
```bash
python launcher.py      # Full control with detailed output
```

### Installation First (if needed)
```bash
# Windows
install.bat

# Linux/Mac
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **Conventional Structure**: Now has expected `main.py` entry point
2. **Multiple Options**: Users can choose their preferred launch method
3. **Platform-Specific**: Optimized scripts for Windows, Linux, and Mac
4. **Error Handling**: All scripts include proper error checking and user feedback
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing `launcher.py` still works as before
6. **User-Friendly**: Clear instructions and helpful error messages

## Entry Point Hierarchy

1. **`main.py`** ← Primary recommendation for new users
2. **`run.bat`/`run.sh`** ← Platform-specific convenience scripts
3. **`run.py`** ← Alternative Python-based quick launcher
4. **`launcher.py`** ← Advanced users and development

The entry point issue has been completely resolved with multiple accessible options for all user types and platforms.
